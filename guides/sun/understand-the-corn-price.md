# Understand the Corn Price

Topcorn uses credit instead of collateral to create Corn price stability relative to its value peg of $1. In practice, this means the protocol incentivizes the regular oscillation of the Corn price above and below its peg. The Corn price will almost never be exactly equal to its peg. Read more about [how Topcorn works](../../introduction/how-topcorn-works.md) or an in-depth overview of the [peg maintenance mechanism](../../peg-maintenance/overview.md).

You can view the current Corn price in US dollars at the upper left corner of [topcorn.tezro.com](https://topcorn.tezro.com).

Selecting the Corn price displays more detail of the liquidity pools that Corns trade in.

Currently, the only liquidity pool is the CORN:BNB pool on PancakeSwap. The detail view shows the:

* USD denominated price of Corn in the liquidity pool;
* USD denominated total liquidity in the liquidity pool, including non-Corn assets;
* deltaB, the shortage or excess of Corns in the liquidity pool. Read more about how deltaB impacts the [Corn supply](../../peg-maintenance/overview.md#corn-supply) and [Soil supply](../../peg-maintenance/overview.md#soil-supply).
