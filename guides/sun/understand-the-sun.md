# Understand the Sun

The Sun keeps time on the Farm in **Seasons** and incentivizes cost-efficient and timely calling of the **sunrise()** function.

You can view [the Sun](../../farm/sun.md) at the upper left corner of [topcorn.tezro.com](https://topcorn.tezro.com/).

The Sun displays the current Season, which is the number of Seasons completed since sunrise() was called for the first time. If [Corns were minted](../../peg-maintenance/overview.md#corn-supply) during the current Season based on the [peg maintenance mechanism](../../peg-maintenance/overview.md), the Sun will appear as a rain cloud icon.

Selecting the Sun displays more detail on historical Seasons and a forecast for the next Season. The following information is shown for each Season:

* Number of new Corns minted,
* [Soil](../../farm/field.md#soil) made available in the [Field](../../farm/field.md),
* [Temperature](../../farm/field.md#weather) for **Sowing Corns**,
* **Pod Rate**,
* **Delta Demand**, if it was used to measure Demand for Soil. If there is between 0 and 1 Soil remaining at the end of any Season,[ Delta Demand is not used](../../peg-maintenance/weather.md#demand-for-soil).
