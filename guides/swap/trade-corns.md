9. If you are trading BNB or have previously approved the token being spent, skip to Step 12. For all other tokens, select “Enable \[Token]”. This allows the Topcorn contract to spend the token, but does not execute the trade yet.
10. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the correct contract before signing it.
11. Select “Exchange”.
