# Trade Corns

Corns can be bought and sold on the Swap page.

1. Make sure you are on [topcorn.tezro.com](https://topcorn.tezro.com) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-topcorn.md).
2. Select “More” then “Swap” to navigate to the Swap page.
3. In the first field select the input token, or the asset you would like to sell. The dropdown menu will show each available input token and your total Balance.
4. In the second field, select the output token, or the asset you would like to buy.
   * Note: Swap must be used to buy or sell Corns, or to wrap or unwrap BNB. Trading between other pairs is not currently supported.
5. Enter the amount of the input token to sell, up to the amount held in your balance.
6. Verify the amount of the output token you will receive in the output field.
7. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
8. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
9. If you are trading BNB or have previously approved the token being spent, skip to Step 12. For all other tokens, select “Enable \[Token]”. This allows the Topcorn contract to spend the token, but does not execute the trade yet.
