### **Selecting and Funding a Wallet**

BSC wallets are applications that let you manage your BSC account. Your wallet lets you connect to decentralized applications such as Topcorn and authorize transactions. On Binance Smart-Chain, you are responsible for the security of your own funds. If you are new to decentralized finance, we strongly recommend researching best practices in wallet security before proceeding.

Topcorn officially supports MetaMask, WalletConnect. WalletConnect is a protocol supported by many wallet applications.

Some wallets allow purchasing BNB directly within the wallet. Alternatively, send BNB from a cryptocurrency exchange to your wallet address. Make sure both sending and receiving addresses are on the BSC network.
