# Add Corn to MetaMask

If you have Corns in your wallet but they do not appear under “Assets” in MetaMask, you can add the Corn BEP-20 token contract as a [custom token](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask) so that MetaMask will recognize your Corn holdings. Note that MetaMask will only show your **Circulating Corns** —your balances within Topcorn can be seen on the **Balances** page.

1. At the bottom of the “Assets” tab in MetaMask, select “import tokens”.
2. Select the “Custom Token” tab.
3. Under “Token Contract Address”, enter “**CONTRACT\_ADDRESS**”. “Token Symbol” will automatically be filled with “CORN”.
4. Select “Add Custom Token”.
5. Select “Import Tokens”.
