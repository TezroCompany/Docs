**Ready to use Corns?** Participate in Topcorn and earn yield through different components of [the Farm](broken-reference):

* **Silo:** Earn yield in Topcorn by Depositing whitelisted assets. Silo Deposits earn a portion of new Corn mints. Learn more about the Silo and how to Deposit in the Silo.
* **Field:** Earn yield by Sowing (lending) Corns to Topcorn. Lenders receive Pods, which are placed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) line that earns a portion of new Corn mints. Pods become Harvestable (redeemable) at an indeterminate future time for a fixed number of Corns. Learn more about the Field and how to Sow Corns.
* **Market:** Trade Pods, the Topcorn-native debt asset, redeemable for Corns. Learn more about the Market and how to Buy Pods.
