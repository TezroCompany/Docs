# Where to Begin

**New to Topcorn?** Learn the basics by reading How TopCorn Works.&#x20;

**Ready to use Corns?** Participate in Topcorn and earn yield through different components of [the Farm](broken-reference):

* **Silo:** Earn yield in Topcorn by [Depositing](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#deposit) whitelisted assets. Silo Deposits earn a portion of new Corn mints. Learn more [about the Silo](../../farm/silo.md) and how to [Deposit in the Silo](../silo/deposit-in-the-silo.md).
* **Field:** Earn yield by [Sowing](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#sow) (lending) Corns to Topcorn. Lenders receive [Pods](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#pods), which are placed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) line that earns a portion of new Corn mints. Pods become [Harvestable](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#harvestable-pods) (redeemable) at an indeterminate future time for a fixed number of Corns. Learn more [about the Field](../../farm/field.md) and how to [Sow Corns](../field/sow-corns.md).
* **Market:** Trade [Pods](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#pods), the Topcorn-native debt asset, redeemable for Corns. Learn more [about the Market](../../farm/market.md) and how to [Buy Pods](../market/buy-pods.md).
