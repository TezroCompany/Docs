# Convert in the Silo

Silo Members can participate in peg maintenance by Converting certain Deposited assets to others within the Silo. You can find more information about Conversions here.

1. Make sure you are on [topcorn.tezro.com](https://topcorn.tezro.com) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-topcorn.md).
2. Navigate to the [“Silo” page](https://topcorn.tezro.com/silo).
3. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the Deposit Whitelist.
4. Select the asset you want to Convert from. For example, to Convert from Corn to another asset, select Corn. You must already have a Deposit of this asset in order to Convert from it. Assets may or may not be convertible at a given time based on [deltaB](../../introduction/how-topcorn-works.md#creating-stability). See Convert Whitelist for additional information.
5.  Select “Convert” and enter the amount of the Deposited asset you would like to Convert.\
