# Understand Silo Deposit Performance

The Silo page is a dashboard for monitoring the balances and performance of your Silo Deposits.

After connecting a wallet on [topcorn.tezro.com](https://topcorn.tezro.com), navigate to the "Silo" page.

The first module provides an overview of your Silo Deposits and their performance over time.

* The "Deposits" tab shows your current USD denominated "Value Deposited" and a chart of historical value. As Silo Deposits generate Earned Corns, Planting them will increase "Value Deposited".
* The "Stalk" tab shows your total "Stalk Balance" and a chart of historical Stalk balances, "Stalk Ownership" and "Stalk Grown per Day".
  * Your "Stalk Balance" will grow as your Seeds yield more Stalk.
  * Stalk entitles holders to passive interest in the form of a share of future Corn mints. Your Stalk is forfeited when you Withdraw your Deposited assets from the Silo.
  * "Stalk Ownership" is your current ownership of Topcorn displayed as a percentage. Ownership is determined by your proportional ownership of the total Stalk supply.
  * "Stalk Grown per Day" is the amount of Stalk grown each day from Seeds. Seeds yield 1/10,000 Stalk each Season.
* The "Seeds" tab shows your "Seeds Balance" and a chart of historical Seed balances.
  * Seeds are received by Depositing assets on the Deposit Whitelist and yield 1/10,000 Stalk each Season.

The second module provides an overview of your Silo Rewards. Read how to Claim Silo Rewards.

* Earned Corns are the number of Corns earned since your last Plant. Upon Plant, Earned Corns are Deposited in the current Season.
* Earned Stalk is the Stalk associated with Earned Corns. Earned Stalk automatically contribute to Stalk ownership and do not require any action to claim them.
* Plantable Seeds are Seeds earned in conjunction with Earned Corns. Plantable Seeds must be Planted in order to grow Stalk.
* Grown Stalk are Stalk earned from Seeds. Grown Stalk does not contribute to Stalk ownership until it is Mown. Grown Stalk is Mown at the beginning of any Silo interaction.

The third module provides information on Deposits categorized by asset. This module can be switched between USD and CDV by selecting your wallet address, "Settings", and choosing a "Fiat display" option.

* The "Rewards" column shows the number of Stalk and Seeds per Corn denominated value (CDV) Deposited. Hover over the column to see the CDV of each asset.
* See [Understand vAPY](understand-vapy.md) for details on the Variable APY calculation.
* "TVD" is the Total Value Deposited from all Depositors.
* The "Amount Deposited" is your amount of Corns or LP Deposited. Note that one unit of LP is not expected to be equal to one Corn. See the current CDV under the "Rewards" column.
* The "Value Deposited" is the value of your Deposits in USD or CDV.
