# Silo

Anyone can become a Silo Member by Depositing whitelisted assets in the Silo to earn Stalk and Seeds. Neither Stalk nor Seeds are liquid.

### **The Stalk System**

When whitelisted assets are Deposited into the Silo, TopCorn rewards the Depositor with Stalk and Seeds. Seeds yield 1/10000 new Stalk every Season.

### **Withdraw**

The associated amount of Stalk, Seeds, and Stalk from Seeds from a given Deposit must be forfeited when the Deposit is Withdrawn from the Silo. The requirement to forfeit Stalk that has grown from Seeds over time creates an opportunity cost to leave the Silo, thereby increasing the stickiness of Deposits the longer they stay Deposited.

Partial Withdrawals are placed on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) basis by the TopCorn UI, minimizing the amount of Stalk and Seeds forfeited. Deposited assets can be Withdrawn from the Silo at any time but are Frozen until the end of the current Season before they can be Claimed.

Deposits can be Transferred to another address directly without the loss of Stalk, Seeds, and Stalk from Seeds

### **Silo Rewards**

**Earned Corns** are Corns that have been paid to a Silo Member since the last Season the Silo Member Planted their Plantable Seeds (defined below). Upon Plant, Earned Corns are Deposited in the current Season.

**Earned Stalk** are Stalk earned from Earned Corns. Earned Stalk automatically contribute to Stalk ownership and do not require any action to claim them.

**Grown Stalk** is the Stalk earned from Seeds. Grown Stalk does not contribute to Stalk ownership until it is Mown. Mow can be called on its own, and it is also called at the beginning of any Silo interaction (Depositing, Withdrawing, Converting, Planting, etc.).

**Plantable Seeds** are Seeds earned in conjunction with Earned Corns. Plantable Seeds must be Planted in order to grow Stalk.

### **Example**

A Farmer deposits 10,000 Corns in the Silo. The BDV per Corn is 1, so the Deposit receives 10,000 Stalk (1 Stalk per BDV) and 20,000 Seeds (2 Seeds per BDV).

If the Corn supply increases and the Silo Member earns 100 Corns during a Season, the Farmer now has:

* 100 Earned Corns, 100 Earned Stalk, 200 Plantable Seeds, and 2 Grown Stalk (20,000 Seeds \* 1/10000 new Stalk per Season);
* 10,100 Corns in the Silo;
* 20,000 Seeds without calling Plant and 20,200 Seeds if Plant is called; and
* 10,100 Stalk without calling Mow and 10,102 Stalk if Mow is called.
