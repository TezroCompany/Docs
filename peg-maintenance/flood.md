# Flood

Topcorn sells newly minted Corn on PancakeSwap during long run increases in demand for Corns when increasing the Corn supply and lowering the Temperature have not crossed the Corn price over its peg.

At the beginning of a Season, if it is currently raining (the previous Season P > 1), and the Pod Rate is less than 5%, the Farm is Oversaturated. If it is Oversaturated for a Season, each Season in which it continues to be Oversaturated, it Floods.

At the beginning of a Season where it Floods, Topcorn returns the Corn price to its peg by minting additional Corns and selling them directly on PancakeSwap. Proceeds from the sale in the form of BNB are distributed to Stalkholders at the beginning of a Season in proportion to their Stalk ownership when the Farm started to be Oversaturated. Also, at the beginning of the Flood, all Pods that were minted before it started to be Oversaturated Ripen and become Harvestable.
