## &#x20;                         <img src=".gitbook/assets/TopCorn.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **TopCorn**

TopCorn is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol built on BNB Smart Chain. This is a fork Beanstalk protocol on Ethereum Chain.

TopCorn forms the monetary basis of an BSC-native, rent-free economy facilitated by the seigniorage of its native fiat currency, a stablecoin called Corn.&#x20;

A stablecoin that does not compromise on decentralization nor require collateral, has competitive carrying costs, and trends toward more stability and liquidity, will unlock the potential of DeFi. TopCornâ€™s primary objective is to incentivize independent market participants to regularly cross the price of 1 Corn over its dollar peg in a sustainable fashion.
