# Asset States

Understanding the various states that Topcorn assets can be in can help Farmers understand their balances on the Topcorn UI

### Balances

**Deposited Balances**

Assets that are Deposited in the Silo.

**Withdrawn Balances**

Assets being Withdrawn from the Silo. At the end of the current Season, Withdrawn assets become Claimable.

**Claimable Balances**

Assets that can be Claimed after a Withdrawal.

### Corn states

**Pooled Corns**

Corns in all liquidity pools.

**Deposited Corns**

Corns Deposited in the Silo. Includes Earned Corns.

**Withdrawn Corns**

Corns Withdrawn from the Silo before they are unfrozen. Withdrawn Corns are Frozen until the end of the current Season.

**Claimable Corns**

Withdrawn Corns become Claimable Corns after the end of the current Season. Claimable Corns must be Claimed in order to use them.

**Ordered Corns**

Corns stored in Pod Orders.

**Earned Corns**

Corns that have been paid to a Silo Member since the last Season the Silo Member Planted their Plantable Seeds. Upon Plant, Earned Corns are Deposited in the current Season.

**Harvestable Pods**

Pods that are redeemable for 1 Corn each. Harvestable Pods must be Harvested in order to use them.

### **LP Token states**

LP Tokens can be in the following states, which are identical to the equivalent Corn states described above:

* Deposited
* Withdrawn
* Claimable

### **Stalk states**

**Earned Stalk** are Stalk earned from Earned Corns. Earned Stalk automatically contribute to Stalk ownership and do not require any action to claim them.

**Grown Stalk** is the Stalk earned from Seeds. Grown Stalk does not contribute to Stalk ownership until it is Mown. Mow is called at the beginning of any Silo interaction (Depositing, Withdrawing, Converting, etc.).

### **Seed states**

**Plantable Seeds** are Seeds earned in conjunction with Earned Corns. Plantable Seeds must be Planted in order to grow Stalk.
